  <h1>What is clustering?</h1>
  <p style="font-size: 70%;text-align: left"><i>Cluster analysis or clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar (in some sense) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters).</i></p>

  <h1>Types of data</h1>
  <p style="text-align: left">When applying clustering to a Cytoscape network there are two basic approaches:</p>
  <ol style="font-size: 70%">
    <li>clustering based on the network topology.  The idea is that nodes that are close
      to each other should in the same cluster and nodes that are further away should be
      in different clusters.  Typically, the goal is to maximize some metric that measures
      inter-cluster distance vs. intra-cluster distance.  MCL and MCODE  are examples
      of clustering based on network toplogy.</li>
    <li>clustering based on attributes.  In this instance, the idea is that similarity is
      not measured based on topology, but on the similarity of the attributes of the nodes
      or edges.  The best examples of attribute-based clustering are hierarchical and k-means.</li>
  </ol>

  <h1>Types of clustering algorithms</h1>
  <dl style="font-size: 70%">
    <dt>agglomerative:&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>bottom-up approach that pairs the "closest" two items, and merges that with the next closest item, etc.<dd>
    <dt>centroid-based:&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>iteratively calculates the centroid of a set of clusters and then refines them, adding or removing items
      from clusters to maximize or minimize some metric (e.g. within-cluster variances).  Centroid-based approaches
      typically require an initial value for the number of clusters.</dd>
    <dt>modularity-based:&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>similar in principle to centroid-based clustering, but the goal is to optimize modularity.</dd>
    <dt>topology-based:&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>a wide variety of algorithms that explicitly use the topology of the graph to cluster it.  This might
      include flow-based approaches, message passing, density metrics, or matrix measures such as eigenvalues.</dd>

  <h1>Types of clustering algorithms</h1>
  <dl style="font-size: 70%">
    <dt>biclusters:&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>simultaneous clustering of rows and columns of a matrix, which yields a subset of rows (or columns) that
        exhibit similar behavior scross a subset of columns (or rows).  The result is often portrayed as a heat map
        with distinctive blocks the represent the biclusters.</dd>
    <dt>fuzzy clusters:&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>typical cluster algorithms assign each individual item to a cluster.  In a fuzzy cluster, items can be assigned
        to multiple clusters, usually depending on some metric of "closeness" to the cluster.</dd>
    <dt>dimensionality reduction:&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>not really a clustering algorithm, but still extremely useful and often used as a visualization aid for grouping
        values.  Dimensionality reduction techniques attempt to reduce the number of dimensions of a data set and plot
        them or display them in some way.</dd>

  <h1>Clustering in Cytoscape</h1>
  <p style="text-align: left;font-size: 70%">There are several Cytoscape apps that perform clustering.  Some are pretty general and
  some are quite specific for certain types of data. Here are some of the most popular apps:
  <dl style="font-size: 70%">
    <dt>MCODE&nbsp;&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>Clusters a given network based purely on topology to find densely connected regions.  Does not support
      any kind of edge weighting</dd>
    <dt>clusterMaker2&nbsp;&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>App that supports attribute clustering, clustering based on topology, cluster ranking, and dimensionality reduction.
      <i>clusterMaker2</i> currently supports 41 different algorithms</dd>
    <dt>cytoHubba&nbsp;&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>Predicts and explores important nodes and subnetworks in a given network by several topological algorithms.</dd>
    <dt>TiCoNE&nbsp;&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>TiCoNE (Time Course Network Enricher) is a tool for the combined analysis of time series expression data together with biological networks.</dd>
    <dt>CytoCluster&nbsp;&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>a Cytoscape app for analysis and visualization of clusters from network</dd>

  <h1>Hands-on</h1>
  <p style="text-align: left">For the hands-on section, we'll explore <i>clusterMaker2</i>, which is used by several different apps, is scriptable, and
  provides support for several different types of clustering algorithms, and a choice of algorithms for each type.  Also, I
  wrote it :-).</p>
