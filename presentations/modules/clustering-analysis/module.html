  <h1>What is clustering?</h1>
  <p style="font-size: 70%;align: left"><i>Cluster analysis or clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar (in some sense) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters).</i></p>

  <h1>General goal</h1>

    <li>Group similar objects together</li>
    <li>Why?

      <li>Help us find patterns in the data</li>

  <h1>Types of data</h1>
  <p>When applying clustering to a Cytoscape network there are two basic approaches:</p>
  <ol style="font-size: 70%">
    <li>clustering based on the network topology.  The idea is that nodes that are close
      to each other should in the same cluster and nodes that are further away should be
      in different clusters.  Typically, the goal is to maximize some metric that measures
      inter-cluster distance vs. intra-cluster distance.  MCL and MCODE  are examples
      of clustering based on network toplogy.</li>
    <li>clustering based on attributes.  In this instance, the idea is that similarity is
      not measured based on topology, but on the similarity of the attributes of the nodes
      or edges.  The best examples of attribute-based clustering are hierarchical and k-means.</li>
  </ol>

  <h1>Clustering in Cytoscape</h1>
  <p>There are several Cytoscape apps that perform clustering.  Some are pretty general and
  some are quite specific for certain types of data. Here are some of the most popular apps:
  <dl style="font-size: 70%">
    <dt>MCODE</dt>
    <dd>Clusters a given network based purely on topology to find densely connected regions.  Does not support
      any kind of edge weighting</dd>
    <dt>clusterMaker2</dt>
    <dd>App that supports attribute clustering, clustering based on topology, cluster ranking, and dimensionality reduction.
      <i>clusterMaker2</i> currently supports 41 different algorithms</dd>
    <dt>cytoHubba</dt>
    <dd>Predicts and explores important nodes and subnetworks in a given network by several topological algorithms.</dd>
    <dd>a Cytoscape app for analysis and visualization of clusters from network</dd>
    <dt>TiCoNE</dt>
    <dt>CytoCluster</dt>
    <dd>Time Course Network Enricher is an interactive clustering method for time-series data</dd>

  <h1>Hands-on</h1>
  <p>For the hands-on section, we'll explore <i>clusterMaker2</i>, which is used by several different apps, is scriptable, and
  provides support for several different types of clustering algorithms, and a choice of algorithms for each type.  Also, I
  wrote it :-).</p>
