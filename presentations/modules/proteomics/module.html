  <p style="text-align:left">Caveats:
  <ul>
    <li>I am not an expert</li>
    <li>This is just some of the basics, there are multiple techniques, different kinds of detecters, different kinds of mass spec machines, etc.</li>
    <li>The goal is just to provide some idea of how this works to help understand the data</li>

  <p style="text-align: left; font-size:80%">When dealing with proteins or lots of peptides, the m/z ratios might be too close to distinguish.  Tandem Mass Spectrometry addresses that by
  adding an additional fragmentation step</p>

  <h2 style="font-size:80%">MaxQuant Columns</h2>
  <p style="text-align:left; font-size: 80%">The most important columns that every proteinGroups.txt file contains are:

  <ul style="font-size:50%">
    <li><b>Protein IDs</b>: a semicolon delimited text listing all protein identifiers that match an identified set of peptides. Most of the time this is just a single protein, but sometimes proteins are so similar to each other because of gene duplication that it was not possible to distinguish them.</li>

    <li><b>Majority protein IDs</b>: a semicolon delimited text that lists all proteins from the Protein IDs column which had more than half of their peptides identified.</li>

    <li><b>Identification type [SAMPLENAME]</b>: For each sample there is one column that explains how the peptide peaks where identified. Either they were directly sequenced by the MS2 (“By MS/MS”) or by matching the m/z peak and elution timing across samples (“By matching”).</li>

    <li><b>Intensity [SAMPLENAME]</b>: The combined intensity of the peptides of the protein. Missing or non-identified proteins are simply stored as 0. In a label-free experiment, this is also often called LFQ Intensity [SAMPLENAME].</li>

    <li><b>iBAQ [SAMPLENAME]</b>: iBAQ is short for intensity-based absolute quantification. It is an attempt to make intensity values comparable across proteins. Usually the intensity values are only relative, which means that they are only comparable within one protein. This is because differences in ionization and detection efficiency. It is usually better to just compare the Intensity columns to identify differentially abundant proteins.</li>

    <li><b>Only identified by site</b>: Contains a “+” if the protein was only identified by a modification site.</li>

    <li><b>Reverse</b>: Contains a “+” if the protein matches the reversed part of the decoy database.</li>

    <li><b>Contaminant</b>: Contains a “+” if the protein is a commonly occurring contaminant.</li>
  </ul>

  <p style="text-align:left; font-size: 80%">The last three columns are commonly used to filter out false positive hits.</p>
